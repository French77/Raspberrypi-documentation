== `libcamera` and `rpicam-apps`

[NOTE]
====
Raspberry Pi OS _Bookworm_ renamed the camera capture applications from `libcamera-\*` to `rpicam-*`. Symbolic links currently allow users to keep using the old application names, but those links will eventually be deprecated. **Adopt the new application names as soon as possible.** Raspberry Pi OS versions prior to _Bookworm_ only provide access to older versions of the suite using the `libcamera-\*` name prefix.

=== Introduction

`libcamera` is an open-source software library aimed at supporting camera systems directly from the Linux operating system on Arm processors. The proprietary code running on the Broadcom GPU, to which users have no access, is almost completely bypassed.

`libcamera` presents a {cpp} API to applications. The library configures the camera, then allows applications to request image frames. These image buffers reside in system memory and can be passed directly to still image encoders (such as JPEG) or to video encoders (such as h.264). Ancillary functions such as encoding images or displaying them are beyond the purview of `libcamera` itself.

For this reason Raspberry Pi supplies a small set of example `rpicam-apps`. These CLI applications, built on top of `libcamera`, capture images and video from a camera. These applications include:

* `rpicam-hello`: A "hello world"-equivalent for cameras, which starts a camera preview stream and displays it on the screen.
* `rpicam-jpeg`: Runs a preview window, then captures high-resolution still images.
* `rpicam-still`: Emulates many of the features of the original `raspistill` application.
* `rpicam-vid`: Captures video.
* `rpicam-raw`: Captures raw (unprocessed Bayer) frames directly from the sensor.
* `rpicam-detect`: Not built by default, but users can build it if they have TensorFlow Lite installed on their Raspberry Pi. Captures JPEG images when certain objects are detected.

Users can create their own rpicam-based applications with custom functionality to suit their own requirements. The https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpicam-apps[`rpicam-apps` source code] is freely available under a BSD 2-Clause licence.

==== More about `libcamera`

`libcamera` is an open source Linux community project. More information is available at the https://libcamera.org[`libcamera` website].

You can find the source code in the https://git.linuxtv.org/libcamera.git/[official libcamera repository]. The Raspberry Pi OS distribution uses a https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera.git[fork] to control updates.

Underneath the `libcamera` core, we provide a custom pipeline handler. `libcamera` uses this layer to drive the sensor and image signal processor (ISP) on the Raspberry Pi. `libcamera` contains a collection of image-processing algorithms (IPAs) including auto exposure/gain control (AEC/AGC), auto white balance (AWB), and auto lens-shading correction (ALSC).

Raspberry Pi's implementation of `libcamera` supports the following cameras:

* Official cameras:
** OV5647 (V1)
** IMX219 (V2)
** IMX477 (HQ)
** IMX296 (GS)
** IMX708 (V3)
* third-party sensors:
** IMX290
** IMX327
** IMX378
** OV9281

To extend support to a new sensor, https://git.linuxtv.org/libcamera.git/[contribute to `libcamera`].

We supply a tuning file for each of these sensors. You can use this tuning file to change the processing performed by the Raspberry Pi hardware on the raw images received from the image sensor, including colour processing, noise suppression, and IPAs.
